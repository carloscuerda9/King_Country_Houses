# Mision | King_Country_Houses

For this mision, we will  work with the file 'King_country_houses.csv' and our goal will be the price of the houses.

Our  first goal is to identify the variables that affect the price, our target, and observe what happens to the same database when we filter for houses that cost more than $650,000.

Finally, create a machine learning model capable of predicting those prices.

### Get the data

We are using the 'King_country_houses.csv` from kaggle link https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/minasameh55/king-country-houses-aa.

### Dealing with the data

We will perform an exploration and preliminary data cleaning
